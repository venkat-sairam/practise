The markdown formatting for mathematical equations in GitHub Markdown (README files or other markdown documents) requires a specific syntax for rendering equations properly. Hereâ€™s how you can adjust your derivation for clarity and correctness in GitHub Markdown:

### Derivation of Ridge Regression Coefficients

#### Step 1: Ridge Regression Objective Function

Start with the ridge regression objective function:

```
min_beta { (y - X*beta)' * (y - X*beta) + lambda * beta' * beta }
```

where:
- `y` is an `n x 1` vector of observed values,
- `X` is an `n x p` matrix of predictors,
- `beta` is a `p x 1` vector of coefficients,
- `lambda` is the regularization parameter.

#### Step 2: Expand the Objective Function

Expand and simplify the ridge regression objective function:

```
(y' * y - 2 * beta' * X' * y + beta' * X' * X * beta + lambda * beta' * beta)
```

```
= y' * y - 2 * y' * X * beta + beta' * X' * X * beta + lambda * beta' * beta
```

#### Step 3: Take the Derivative

To find the ridge regression coefficients, take the derivative of the objective function with respect to `beta` and set it to zero:

```
-2 * X' * y + 2 * X' * X * beta + 2 * lambda * beta = 0
```

#### Step 4: Solve for `beta`

Now, solve the equation for `beta`:

```
(X' * X + lambda * I) * beta = X' * y
```

```
beta = inverse(X' * X + lambda * I) * X' * y
```

### Interpretation

The formula `beta = inverse(X' * X + lambda * I) * X' * y` gives us the coefficients for ridge regression.

This equation adjusts the coefficients `beta` to minimize the sum of squared residuals while penalizing them by the regularization parameter `lambda`. This penalty helps prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients, particularly useful when predictors are correlated (multicollinearity).
